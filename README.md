# U.S. Mortality Insights Dashboard (2020â€“2025)

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes monthly death statistics across the United States from 2020 to 2025. Using real-world data from Data.gov, the dashboard highlights key public health insights, cause-specific death trends, and the impact of COVID-19.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore large-scale mortality data and present clear, accessible insights into how causes of death have shifted during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The dashboard supports filtering by year, month, and cause, and visualizes death trends over time.

This analysis answers questions such as:
- What were the top causes of death in the U.S. between 2020 and 2025?
- How did COVID-19 compare to other causes like heart disease, cancer, and overdose?
- Which months recorded the highest number of deaths?
- What patterns or seasonality exist in different causes of death?

## Tools Used

- Power BI (dashboard design and visualization)
- Power Query (data transformation, unpivoting columns)
- DAX (custom KPI calculations)
- Dataset Source: [Monthly Provisional Counts of Deaths by Select Causes (CDC Data)](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Monthly-Counts-of-Deaths-by-Select-Causes-2020-2025/9dzk-mvmi)

## Key Features

- Interactive dashboard with filtering by year, month, and cause
- KPI cards for Total Deaths, COVID-19 Deaths, Peak Month, and Top Cause
- Visualizations include line charts, donut charts, bar graphs, and area charts
- Trend comparison of COVID-19 against chronic illnesses and accidents
- Dynamic monthly and seasonal mortality insights
